This project is about developing a software application that helps a business manage the scheduling and tracking of customer pickups. The software is designed to be used by businesses that offer a pickup service to their customers, such as restaurants, retailers, and other types of businesses.

The main goal of the software is to make the process of scheduling and managing customer pickups more efficient and streamlined. With the software, businesses can easily schedule pickups for their customers, track the status of each pickup, and communicate with customers about the status of their orders.

The software works by allowing businesses to create a pickup schedule for each day, specifying the available pickup times and the number of pickups that can be accommodated at each time. Customers can then book a pickup time through the software, which will automatically update the pickup schedule and notify the business of the new booking.

The software also provides real-time tracking of each pickup, allowing businesses to monitor the status of each pickup and make any necessary adjustments to their pickup schedule. Customers can also receive updates on the status of their orders, such as when their order is ready for pickup or if there are any delays or changes to the pickup schedule.

Overall, the software is designed to help businesses improve their pickup service and provide a better experience for their customers. By automating the scheduling and tracking of pickups, businesses can save time and resources, while also improving their customer service and increasing customer satisfaction.

In Order to implement this code you will be requiring a front end UI to fetch customer pickuo and drop off requests which will include the customer pickup location and dropoff locations, for this simulation we have passed a sample data using a CSV file. The CSV files muct contain the Pickup and dropoff coordinates, along with the number of passengers. 

Same data can be gathered from a front end UI which we will be working on and uploading soon.
